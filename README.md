## Hi there 👋


- 🌱 I am an environmental scientist, graduated from the University of Brasília (UnB), and I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Environmental Data Science at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). I enjoy learning and applying my knowledge to real-world environmental problems in a practical and accessible way.
